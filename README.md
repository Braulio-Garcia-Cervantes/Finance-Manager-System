# Finance-Manager-System

  - Developed a console-based Finance Manager program where users can track their monthly expenses
  - Use of algorithms to make calculations for the user, based on the information that was given by the user (ex: monthly income, savings goals, budgets, etc.)
  - Implementation of Hash Maps to link category names to the amounts that the user enters as an expense or budget for that specific category
  - Implemented a custom user interface that updates constantly when changes are made by the user
